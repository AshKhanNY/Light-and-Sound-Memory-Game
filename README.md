SITE Pre-Work Submission
========================
Name: Ashraq Khan
------------------------
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
> I used websites like w3schools.com and freeCodeCamp.org to find different colors to customize my website, as well as learn about all the
different types of listeners and customization options there are.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
> A challenge that I encountered while creating this submission is finding out the best way to format the logic statements near the end of the
assignment. I understand what I had to do, but what I see and process through my eyes is very different than what another programmer sees. In 
other words, I might think that a piece of code looks fine and sensical to me, but to my co-worker or boss, it may look like a big mess.
I tried to nest the logic statements in a way where other people can look at it and think it's logical and easy to follow. I also placed comments
wherever necessary, to ensure that others can know what I mean when I write a few blocks of code. It also serves as a good reminder for myself, if
I want to come back to this project sometime in the future.
Going back to the game logic aspect of this project, sometimes you don't want to write too many if-else statements. It is better to shorten it and
"clean up" anything that is unnecessary or redundant. I took this problem to my own hands, and developed a series of statements on my own without looking
at the solution. After a few minutes of tweaking, I believe I made a decent conditional block that follows the diagram provided by the CodePath website.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
> I'm left to ponder about how the user experience can be improved upon finishing a website. Is there a way to retrieve information about how users
are interacting with the website? What happens when the website crashes or faces a problem? How can we make websites a better experience for people with
accessibility problems or disabilities?
Another question is how do we make sure that websites look just as good on mobile devices and tablets when compared to a PC? Some websites, when loaded on
your phone, look exactly like how their PC equivalent would look like, but it's hard to press on small links or scroll/click on items without a mouse. 
Now I want to think about how this can benefit people in the future. Why use a website over an application on your computer or phone? What are some benefits of 
having a website when compared to an app? When can I know if I should use a website to handle a customer's request over other types of software? How do I choose
what type of website I should make or work on when I'm working for a company or client?
These are all questions I can think of off the top of my head, and I wish to learn more about web development with these in mind.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
> If I had a few more hours, I'd definitely add many more features. Right now, the game is very basic, and I plan on doing almost all the optional features to make
this an incredibly fun game. Some features of a game include a custom UI, found in a specific settings tab, a difficulty tuner, and some background video game music.
I would add some 8-bit free music in the background, and give the user an option to play an easy mode (where the buttons light up in a slower pace), a hard mode
(buttons light up in a faster pace and don't stay lit up for too long), and an endless mode (where the buttons behave similarly as they do in easy mode, but the game
keeps going until the user messes up and it records the highest score). I would also change the look of the font and background to make it appear more colorful and 
cheerful. Perhaps adding animations to the buttons will make this project look a little more professional, as well as an audio cue for when you get a button right or
wrong.
